# Euclidean Distance

### Definition

---------------------------------
The **Euclidean Distance** bewteen points **p** and **q** is the length of the [line segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment) connecting the them (**pq**).

In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = (p1, p2,..., pn) and **q** = (q1, q2,..., qn) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then\
the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:

\[
d(\mathbf{p,q})=d(\mathbf{q,p})=\sqrt{(q_1-p_2)^2+(q_1-p_2)^2+\dots+(q_n-p_n)^2}\\=
\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (q_i-p_i)^2}
\]

The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as\
Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at\
the two points. The [**Euclidean norm**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)#Euclidean_norm), or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of\
the vector:

\[
\|\mathbf{p}\|=\sqrt{p_1^2+p_2^2+\dots+p_n^2}=\sqrt{\mathbf{p\cdot p}},
\]

where the last expression involves the dot product.
